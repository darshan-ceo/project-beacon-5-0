    "summary": "Master data forms the foundation of Project Beacon's litigation management system. These reference entities define the WHO (Employees, Contacts, Judges), WHERE (Legal Authorities), and WHEN (Statutory Deadlines) of case management.",
    "systemImpact": "Incorrect or incomplete master data propagates errors across cases, hearings, tasks, and reports. A single wrong court assignment can cause missed deadlines and compliance failures.",
    "governanceNote": "Master data changes are audited. Deletions are soft by design to preserve referential integrity with historical records."
