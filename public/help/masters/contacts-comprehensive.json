    {
      "question": "What's the difference between standalone and client-linked contacts?",
      "answer": "Standalone contacts are independent (prospects, opposing counsel). Client-linked contacts are associated with a specific client and inherit client visibility. Link when relationship is confirmed."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I give a contact portal access?",
      "answer": "Ensure contact is linked to a client, verify their identity, then use Portal Access provisioning. System creates auth credentials and portal_user record."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can the same person be a contact for multiple clients?",
      "answer": "Currently, a contact can only be linked to one client. If same person represents multiple clients, create separate contact records or use standalone with case-level associations."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I handle a GDPR deletion request?",
      "answer": "Use soft-delete with audit trail documenting the request. System retains minimal records for legal compliance while removing from active use."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens if I mark wrong person as primary?",
      "answer": "Primary contacts receive important notifications. If wrong person marked, immediately update primary flag and review recent communications for any issues."
