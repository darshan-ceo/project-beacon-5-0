  "philosophy": "In GST litigation, escalation management is not just operational efficiency—it's professional survival. GST cases involve unforgiving statutory deadlines where missing a 30-day appeal window or 60-day response period can result in significant financial losses for clients and potential negligence claims against practitioners. Our escalation system ensures that no critical deadline slips through organizational cracks and that appropriate expertise is engaged before problems become crises.",
