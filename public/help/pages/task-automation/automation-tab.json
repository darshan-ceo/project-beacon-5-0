  "philosophy": "Automation in GST litigation is not just convenience—it's essential risk management. GST cases involve strict statutory timelines (30-day appeal windows, 60-day refund claim responses) where missing deadlines can result in significant financial penalties for clients and potential malpractice exposure for practitioners. Our automation ensures systematic compliance with all GST procedural requirements.",
