      "content": "The system uses two complementary role systems:\n\n1. **Employee Roles** - Organizational job titles (Partner, CA, Advocate, Manager, Staff, RM, Finance, Admin)\n2. **RBAC Roles** - System permission levels (SuperAdmin, Admin, Manager, Staff, ReadOnly)\n\nThese systems work together automatically to ensure employees have appropriate system access based on their organizational role."

They help with:\n- Case assignments\n- Task delegation\n- Organizational reporting\n- Workload management\n\n**RBAC Roles** control system permissions and access. They manage:\n- What features users can access\n- What data they can view and modify\n- Administrative capabilities\n- Security boundaries"

Click the eye icon to preview permissions\n\n**Important Notes:**\n- Only active employees receive RBAC roles\n- Deactivating an employee removes their system access\n- Manual RBAC role assignments are preserved\n- Changes take effect immediately"
