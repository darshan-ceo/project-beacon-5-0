    {
      "question": "What's the maximum file size for import?",
      "answer": "10MB for most file types. For larger datasets, split into multiple files or contact admin for server-side import."

    {
      "question": "How do I update existing records via import?",
      "answer": "Include the system ID column in your import file. Records with matching IDs will be updated rather than created new."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is my import failing validation?",
      "answer": "Check the validation report for specific errors. Common issues: missing required fields, date format mismatches, reference data not found."
