  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Can I undo an import?",
      "answer": "Not automatically. You need to identify imported records and delete them manually, or restore from backup. This is why testing with small batches is critical."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does my import keep timing out?",
      "answer": "Large files may exceed processing limits. Split into smaller batches (1000-5000 records). Also check network stability."

    {
      "question": "How do I update existing records via import?",
      "answer": "Include the system ID column in your import file. The system will match by ID and update existing records instead of creating new ones."
