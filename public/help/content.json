    "content": "# Task Automation Best Practices\n\n## 1) What this page does\n\nAutomates repetitive tasks and reminders in Litigation GST CRM—like creating tasks after a hearing, sending deadline alerts, or assigning follow-ups to the right user.\n\n## 2) Why it matters (business value)\n\n• No missed hearing dates, filings, or client updates\n• Faster task assignment with fewer manual steps  \n• Clear ownership and on-time closures\n• Consistent client experience (timely WhatsApp/email updates)\n\n## 3) When to use this page\n\n• New case created and you want auto-tasks (KYC, document checklist)\n• Hearing date updated; you want reminders to the advocate + client\n• Order uploaded; you want a task to draft submission/appeal\n• Escalate if a task is delayed beyond SLA\n\n## 4) What's on this page (map of UI)\n\n### Sub-tabs\n\n• **Rules:** Create/edit automation rules (trigger → conditions → action)\n• **Schedules:** Time-based jobs (e.g., nightly reminders at 6:00 PM)\n• **Triggers:** System events you can listen to (Case Created, Hearing Updated, Order Added, Task Overdue, Document Missing)\n• **Actions:** What to do (Create Task, Assign User, Set Due Date, Send Email/WhatsApp, Change Status, Add Tag, Create Note)\n• **Logs:** See every rule run, success/error, and payload\n• **Templates:** Save/reuse message and task templates\n\n### Buttons / Actions\n\n• **New Rule:** Build a new automation\n• **Enable/Disable:** Turn a rule on/off\n• **Edit:** Change a rule's logic\n• **Test Rule:** Run rule on sample data; view outcome (no impact on live)\n• **Run Now (Schedules):** Execute a schedule immediately\n• **Import/Export:** Backup or move rules between environments\n• **View Logs:** Filter by rule, status, or time\n\n## 5) How to set it up / use it (step-by-step)\n\n1. Go to **Automation → Rules → New Rule**\n2. **Select Trigger** (e.g., *Hearing Updated*)\n3. **Add Conditions** (e.g., *Next Hearing Date is in 3 days* AND *Case Status = Active*)\n4. **Choose Actions** (e.g., *Create Task* → \"Prepare hearing brief\", due in 2 days; *Send WhatsApp to Client* using template)\n5. **Assign Owner** (role or specific user) and **set priority/SLA**\n6. Click **Test Rule** (choose a sample case). Verify the preview\n7. **Enable** the rule\n8. Check **Logs** after the first few runs to confirm behavior\n\n## 6) Examples (copy-paste ready)\n\n### Auto-task for upcoming hearing\n• Trigger: *Hearing Updated*\n• Condition: *Next Hearing Date in 3 days*\n• Actions: *Create Task \"Prepare Brief\"* (due in 2 days, priority High) + *Notify Advocate via Email*\n\n### Client WhatsApp after order upload\n• Trigger: *Order Document Added*\n• Actions: *Send WhatsApp* using template \"Order uploaded—please review by {date}. Reply OK to confirm.\"\n\n### Escalation for overdue tasks\n• Trigger: *Task Overdue*\n• Condition: *Priority = High* AND *Overdue > 24 hrs*\n• Actions: *Email Team Lead* + *Add Tag \"SLA-Breach\"* + *Increase Priority*\n\n## 7) Best practices\n\n• Keep each rule focused on **one business outcome**\n• Always **Test Rule** before enabling\n• Use **Templates** to standardize messages\n• Review **Logs weekly**; disable rules that are no longer needed\n\n## 8) Common mistakes & quick fixes\n\n• *Nothing happens?* → Rule may be **Disabled** or trigger never fires; check **Logs**\n• *Duplicate tasks?* → Add a **Condition** (e.g., \"Task not already open\")\n• *Wrong recipients?* → Check **Owner/Role mapping** in Actions\n• *Messages not sending?* → Verify **channel templates** and integration status\n\n## 9) Related pages & dependencies\n\n• **Cases → Hearings** (updates fire triggers)\n• **Tasks** (owners, due dates, SLA)\n• **Contacts** (client communication channels)\n• **Documents (DMS)** (order/judgment uploads)\n\n## 10) Permissions & audit\n\n• Only **Admins/Managers** can create/enable rules\n• All runs are recorded in **Logs** with timestamp, actor, and result\n\n## 11) Glossary\n\n• **Trigger:** Event that starts an automation (e.g., Hearing Updated)\n• **Condition:** Filters that must be true (e.g., status is Active)\n• **Action:** What the system does (e.g., create a task, send WhatsApp)\n• **SLA:** Target response/closure time for a task",
