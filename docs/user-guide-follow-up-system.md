# Task Follow-Up System User Guide

## Overview
The new follow-up system provides better tracking and audit trails for task progress.

## Key Concepts

### Task Locking
- **When created:** Tasks are fully editable
- **After first follow-up:** Tasks automatically lock
- **Why?** Preserves the original assignment and maintains audit trail

### Adding Follow-Ups
1. Open a task in the task drawer
2. Click "Add Follow-Up" button
3. Fill in:
   - What work was done (required, min 20 characters)
   - Outcome (Progressing, Blocked, Completed, etc.)
   - Status update
   - Hours worked
   - Next follow-up date
   - Blockers or support needed

### Locked Tasks
- Task definition (title, description, assignment) cannot be changed
- Only follow-ups can be added
- Status, completion, and hours update through follow-ups
- Visible lock badge in task lists and cards

### Admin Override
- Administrators can unlock tasks if needed
- All override actions are logged
- Used for correcting mistakes in original assignment
